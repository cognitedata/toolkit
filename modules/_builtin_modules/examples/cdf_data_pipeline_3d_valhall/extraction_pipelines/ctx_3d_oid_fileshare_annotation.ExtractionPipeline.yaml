  # 3D model and assets Contextualization
 
  The 3d model and assets Contextualization runs as a process in CDF Functions. Process triggers on new 3d model that not is connected to an asset.
  The process stages are as follows:


  ```
    Read configuration and start process by
    1. Read RAW table with manual mappings and extract all rows not contextualized
    2. Apply manual mappings from 3D nodes to Asset - this will overwrite any existing mapping
    3. Read all time series not matched (or all if runAll is True)
    4. Read all assets
    5. Run ML contextualization to match 3D Nodes -> Assets
    6. Update 3D Nodes with mapping
    7. Write results matched (good) not matched (bad) to RAW
    8. Output in good/bad table can then be used in workflow to update manual mappings
  ```

  Default configuration is provided as part of the deployment, but can be overwritten by configuration provided in configuration section below:
 
  ```
   # if True, run without writing any annotations to CDF
   debug: False
   # if True run contextualization on all 3d model, if False only run on 3d model that not is linked to an asset
   runAll: False
   # RAW DB used to store input and results for contextualization
   rawdb: '3d_{{location_name}}_{{source_name}}'
   # RAW table used to store all manual input for mapping that should be used in contextualization
   # This table could be populated from earlier mappings that are approved or used for manual override
   rawTableManual: 'contextualization_manual_input'
   # RAW table used to store all mapping that was automatically approved as good
   rawTableGood: 'contextualization_good'
   # RAW table used to store all mapping that NOT was automatically approved
   rawTableBad: 'contextualization_bad'
   # ExternalId for root assets to be used for contextualization
   assetRootExtIds {{external_root_id_asset}}
   # externalId for 3d data set
   3dDataSetExtId: 'ds_3d_{{location_name}}'
   # Name of 3d model
   3dModelName: {{3d_model_name}}
   # Number between 0 and 1, indication of strict the matching should be 1 = only exact matches
   matchThreshold: 0.75
   # if True keep old mapping, if False overwrite old mapping
   keepOldMapping: False

  ```
