  # Time series and assets Contextualization
 
  The Time series and assets Contextualization runs as a process in CDF Functions. Process triggers on new time series that not is connected to an asset.
  The process stages are as follows:


  ```
    Read configuration and start process by:
    1. Read RAW table with manual mappings and extract all rows not contextualized
    2. Apply manual mappings from TS to Asset - this will overwrite any existing mapping
    3. Read all time series not matched (or all if runAll is True)
    4. Read all assets
    5. Run ML contextualization to match TS -> Assets
    6. Update TS with mapping
    7. Write results matched (good) not matched (bad) to RAW
    8. Output in good/bad table can then be used in workflow to update manual mappings
  ```

  Default configuration is provided as part of the deployment, but can be overwritten by configuration provided in configuration section below:
 
  ```
   # if True, run without writing any annotations to CDF
   debug: False
   # if True run contextualization on all time series, if False only run on time series that not is linked to an asset
   runAll: False
   # RAW DB used to store input and results for contextualization
   rawdb: 'timeseries_{{location_name}}_{{source_name}}'
   # RAW table used to store all manual input for mapping that should be used in contextualization
   # This table could be populated from earlier mappings that are approved or used for manual override
   rawTableManual: 'contextualization_manual_input'
   # RAW table used to store all mapping that was automatically approved as good
   rawTableGood: 'contextualization_good'
   # RAW table used to store all mapping that NOT was automatically approved
   rawTableBad: 'contextualization_bad'
   # Prefix used for all time series that is used in contextualization
   timeSeriesPrefix: [pi_, opc-ua]
   # List of externalId for root assets to be used for contextualization
   assetRootExtIds: [{{external_root_id_asset}}]
   # Number between 0 and 1, indication of strict the matching should be 1 = only exact matches
   matchThreshold: 0.85

  ```
