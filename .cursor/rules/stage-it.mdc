# Stage It

When the user says **"stage it"**:

## 1. Stage changes

- Run `git add .` to stage all changes. **Never stage** `.cursor/` or other local-only files (exclude with `git reset HEAD .cursor/` if accidentally staged).

## 2. Show changes for review

- Run `git diff --cached --stat` to show a summary of changed files.
- Run `git diff --cached` to show the full diff.
- Present the changes clearly to the user and **wait for confirmation** before proceeding.
- Do **not** commit or push — that is handled by "send it".
