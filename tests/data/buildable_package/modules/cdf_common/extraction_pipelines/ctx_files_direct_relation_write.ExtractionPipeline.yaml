  # Direct Relation Writer

  This extraction pipeline is responsible for writing the direct relations into 
  a data model based on annotations.

  ## Annotations
  Annotations are found based on three criteria:

  1. It has to have data in the (`cdf_cdm", "CogniteAnnotation`, `v1`) view.
  2. It is stored in the space configured in the `annotationSpace`.
  3. It has to have a `sourceContext` that contains the views of the start and end nodes of the relations.

  ```json
  {"start" : {
    "space": "cdf_cdm",
    "externalId": "CogniteFile",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  "end" : {
    "space": "cdf_cdm",
    "externalId": "CogniteAsset",
    "version": "v1"
  }}
  ```

  ## Configuration

  The configuration of the direct relation writer:

  ```yaml
  state: # The Annotation writer uses the instances/sync endpoint to fetch annotations. 
    # The state stores the last cursor.
    rawDatabase: <>
    rawTable: <>
  data:
    annotationSpace: <> # The space the edges for the annotations are stored.
    directRelationMapping: # How to go from Annotation to DirectRelation
      - startNodeView: # The view of the start node.
         space: <> .
         externalId: <>
         version: <> 
         directRelationProperty: <> # The property that contains the direct relation.
          # Must be set either on the start or end node.
        endNodeView: # The view of the end node.
          space: <>
          externalId: <>
          version: <>
          # directRelationProperty: <> # Must be set either on the start or end node.
  ```
