  description: Writes direct relations based on annotations.
  documentation: "# Direct Relation Writer\nThis extraction pipeline is responsible\
    \ for writing the direct relations into  a data model based on annotations.\n\
    ## Annotations Annotations are found based on three criteria:\n1. It has to have\
    \ data in the (`cdf_cdm\", \"CogniteAnnotation`, `v1`) view. 2. It is stored in\
    \ the space configured in the `annotationSpace`. 3. It has to have a `sourceContext`\
    \ that contains the views of the start and end nodes of the relations.\n```json\
    \ {\"start\" : {\n  \"space\": \"cdf_cdm\",\n  \"externalId\": \"CogniteFile\"\
    ,\n  \"version\": \"v1\"\n}, \"end\" : {\n  \"space\": \"cdf_cdm\",\n  \"externalId\"\
    : \"CogniteAsset\",\n  \"version\": \"v1\"\n}} ```\n## Configuration\nThe configuration\
    \ of the direct relation writer:\n```yaml state: # The Annotation writer uses\
    \ the instances/sync endpoint to fetch annotations. \n  # The state stores the\
    \ last cursor.\n  rawDatabase: <>\n  rawTable: <>\ndata:\n  annotationSpace: <>\
    \ # The space the edges for the annotations are stored.\n  directRelationMapping:\
    \ # How to go from Annotation to DirectRelation\n    - startNodeView: # The view\
    \ of the start node.\n       space: <> .\n       externalId: <>\n       version:\
    \ <> \n       directRelationProperty: <> # The property that contains the direct\
    \ relation.\n        # Must be set either on the start or end node.\n      endNodeView:\
    \ # The view of the end node.\n        space: <>\n        externalId: <>\n   \
    \     version: <>\n        # directRelationProperty: <> # Must be set either on\
    \ the start or end node.\n```\n"
