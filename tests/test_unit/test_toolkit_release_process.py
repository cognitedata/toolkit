### Changed

- The `cdf dump datamodel` no longer includes data models that are global (in system space). You can get the original behavior by using the `--include-global` flag.
- Toolkit now stores a hash of the credentials of Workflow/Transformation/Function in the resources such that the resource is updated when the credentials change.
- For Workflow/Transformations/Function Toolkit no longer falls back to Toolkit credentials when validation-type != 'dev' in the `config.[env].yaml`.

### Added
- Toolkit now support for `cdf dump workflow/transformation/group/node`.

No changes.

Bootcamps. Hence the requirements for testing and typing etc are a bit
more relaxed.
