# EDIT THIS FILE!!!
#
# This file controls which modules will be built and deployed.
#
# local.yaml should be checked into code repository.
# It contains the environment definitions to control build and deploy.
# Use build.sh --env <env> to specify which environment to build and deploy
# where <env> is the name of one of the below environment in local.yaml (root-level key)
#
# Note that the following environment variables will be set:
# CDF_ENVIRON = name of the environment (e.g. demo)
# CDF_BUILD_TYPE = type of the environment (dev, staging, prod)
# 
# If you set CDF_PROJECT as an environment variable, the environment you are trying to
# deploy to must have the same project name configured below. This is a safety measure
# to prevent you from accidentally deploying to the wrong environment.
demo:
  project: <a-demo-project>
  type: dev
  # This should be a used to specify which modules and packages to deploy locally and in the GitHub Action.
  # You can have multiple deploy commands.
  # Order is important.
